A dart package of [String](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.14.0/dart-core/String-class.html) validators and sanitizers.
Inspired by [validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js)

## Installation

Run this command:
With Dart:

```
dart pub add flutter_validators
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit `dart pub get`):

```
dependencies:
  flutter_validators: ^1.0.0
```

## Usage

Import the package in your Dart file:
```
import 'package:flutter_validators/flutter_validators.dart';
```

Now, you can call the respective validator method.

```
  var email = 'foo@bar.com';

  print(isEmail(email)); // true
```

To have more streamlined code use built-in String extension methods

```
print('foo@bar.com'.isEmail);
```
